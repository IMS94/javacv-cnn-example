# JavaCV CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) Example for Age and Gender Recognition

A sample repository to demonstrate the usage of JavaCV and CNN for gender and age recognition. **Please refer [Age and gender recognition with JavaCV and CNN](https://medium.com/@Imesha94/age-and-gender-recognition-with-javacv-and-cnn-fdebb3d436c0) for the step by step guide.**

This repository has made use of CNNs trained by [Gil Levi and Tal Hassner in 2015](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender).

This simple program is capable of detecting human faces and predicting the gender and age of the detected face.
